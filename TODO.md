#To-do's

##Must do
```
[ ] Add a helper library for functions reuse.
[ ] Add Point and Map classes to model the environment in a better way. `comida` sort of does that now.
[ ] Change classes names to capitalized convention.
[ ] Change variable names to English. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[ ] Change code style to fit conventions.
[ ] Fix floating point bug.
```

##Nice to have
```
[ ] Add real machine learning / artificial intelligence to UC's and Sembradore's.
[ ] Move it a 3D world.
```
